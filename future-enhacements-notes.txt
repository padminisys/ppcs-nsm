Currently We are accepting api payload request that includes ns as well 
but in future we should not ask for ns as user details are already coming in auth header
from auth header retrive user details and then lookup in our db which ns is mapped against user.
ns is equal to entity.
so a user may be attached to multiple entity.
so besides auth header a entity/ns details will be coming in payload so as defence layer , we should build mechnism to verify it by hitting db before honoring request.
As of now direct honoring is enabled.
